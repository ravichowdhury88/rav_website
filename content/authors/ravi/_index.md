I am a Research Data Analyst at [*Northwestern University*](https://www.northwestern.edu) and work for the [*Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Memorial Hospital*](https://nm.org). I like working with R and try to make peoples life easy by making reproducible reports. I love working on data visualization as well as rmarkdown for reporting. I want to post about various projects and tips that I have learned and still learning to help others.
