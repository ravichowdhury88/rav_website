I am a Research Data Analyst at Northwestern University. I am an international keynote [speaker](/talks), [award-winning educator](/resume/#accomplishments), and co-author of the book [*blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I love creating [unique platforms](/projects) for sharing knowledge and data-driven insights, from websites to presentations and everything in between. I am known for being a compassionate leader and enthusiastic collaborator, and for making user-facing experiences that engage and delight.
